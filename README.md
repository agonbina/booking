### Implementation details

The application consists of three different views that each deal with a piece of functionality of the whole
    "room booking" flow:
* [Attendees](/views/attendees) The user can choose to pre-select the members who are attending the meeting using a
    simple drag and drop interface. Here they can also add or remove members from this organization(team).
* [Search](/views/search) Here the user may search for the available rooms.
* [Book Room](/views/book-room) This is the view where the user can finalize a booking after they have selected a room.


### Third party libraries

* [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) I really like all the modules and the syntax that Semantic UI has developed.
* [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org)
* jQuery
